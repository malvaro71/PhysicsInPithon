# A sailboat is moving with a speed of 4 km/h in the NNE (north-northeast) direction. 
# What are the components of the speed of the ship in the North direction and in the East direction?

# If we place the x-axis in the easterly direction and the y-axis in the north direction, the NNE 
# (north-northeast) direction forms an angle of 67.5ยบ (or 3PI/8 radians) with the east.
# Then, x-component of speed of the ship is
